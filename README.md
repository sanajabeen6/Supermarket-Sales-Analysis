# Supermarket Sales Analysis

This project analyzes supermarket sales data for a retail chain over a 3-month period (Jan–Mar 2019).

Key highlights:
- Total sales performance by branch
- Top-selling product lines
- Member vs Non-member spending
- Customer satisfaction ratings
- Daily sales trends

The analysis was done in Python using Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot to speed up coding and generate code snippets.

#Instructions to use
- `supermarket.py` — contains the full Python script for the analysis.
- Open the script in your IDE, update the dataset path if needed, and run it to reproduce the results.
